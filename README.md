# Instagram-bot
instagram automatic bot, works with api

This is instagram-bot v1.0.0

The bot currently support multi auto likes only.

It was written in python with the following libs:
Flask, selenium, ConfigParser and logging.

Choose your log path in LogHandler.py file.
It containg a full logging system (to files).

The configurations (such as username, password, tags and number of likes) are located in the config.ini file.

I upload it with a controller using flask, but you can use it also as a simple script.

Hope you will enjoy :)
